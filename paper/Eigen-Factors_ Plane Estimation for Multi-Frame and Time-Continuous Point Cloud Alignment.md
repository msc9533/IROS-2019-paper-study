## Main Contribution

- EFs are a reformulation of plane estimation for multiframe PC alignment. EFs’ complexity is independent of the number of points. 
- Closed-form derivation of the EFs’ gradients using SE(3) and Lie algebra. 
- A time-continuous derivation of EFs using interpolation in the manifold.
